Description: Pure Lua openstreetmap utility for the nginx embedded Lua language
 This modules provides a pure Lua openstreetmap utility for the
 embedded nginx's Lua interpreter.
 .
 This includes (meta)tile utility, tirex driver and tile url utilities, which
 make easy to build OpenStreetMap tile server with Nginx and Tirex.
 .
 Because this module is based on the ngx_lua's cosocket API, it inherits
 the advantage of a real nonblocking behaviour running effectively on the
 underlying nginx server ultra-fast technology design.
